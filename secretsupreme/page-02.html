		<h3>Objective Elements</h3>
		<p>First 25 Elements are Objective meaning Gross Elements, the five mahabhutas, <br>the five tanmatras, the five karmmdriyas, and the five jnanendriyas, are called gross elements. </p>
		

		<p> Lets begin from the Lowest degree of tatvas - <u>gross tatvas</u> <br>
		Famously known as <u>Pañca Mahābhūtās</u> <br>
		<br>
	        <span style="color: #fbb0b0;">
                pŗithvī = earth <br>
                jala = water <br> 
		tejas = fire <br>
		vāyu = air <br> 
	 	ākāśa = ether 
                </span>
		<br>

		Here ākāśa i.e ether element is not perceptible because it is unoccupied space.<br>
		It gives room to exist and move to the other perceptible gross elements. <br>
		Its like special vacume which filled with other gross elements. <br>
		<br>
		<div style="border:3px double white">
		These tatvas are gross and called Mahabhutas (great elemenents) because whole universe <br>
		is based on these elements.</div> <br>
		</p>
		<br>

		<strong>Pañcha Tanmätras — Five Subtle Elements</strong>
		<p> The five tanmatras correspond to the five mahdbhutas. </p>
		<table style="color: #ecce95;width:fit-content;margin:auto">

		<strong>Pañca karmendriyas — Five organs of action</strong>

		<p>After the five tanmdtras comes out the five tattvas which are known as the five karmendriyas, the five organs of action.<br>
		</p>

		<strong>Pañca jnanendriyas — Five Organs of Cognition</strong>
		<p>The next five tattvas comprise what are known as the five organs of cognition, the five jnanendriyas means organs of knowledge. These are the mental organs with which we experience the world. </p>

		<h3>Objective cum Subjective Elements</h3>
		<p><small style="text-align: left">The following elements, as we continue rising in our explaination of the tattvas, are said to be objective cum subjective elements. You should understand though, that in saivism all the elements are really objective elements, they are called objects. Only that Super Being is subjective. Yet as the following elements are a bit more attached with subjectivity than the former we say that they are objective cum subjective elements.</small>
		</p>
	
		<strong>Antaḥkaraṇas — Three Internal Organs</strong>
		<p> Now we rise to the three tattvas which are known as the antahkaranas. The word ‘antahkararm’ means internal organs.</p>
			<table style="color:#b7b8f9;;width:fit-content;margin:auto">
			<tr>
				<th>Tatva</th>
				<th>Organ</th>
				<th>Indication</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>manas</td>
				<td>mind</td>
				<td>creating thoughts</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>buddhiḥ</td>
				<td>intellect</td>
				<td>decision making</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>ahaṁkāra</td>
				<td>ego (objective)</td>
				<td>attributing to I</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>prakŗiti</td>
				<td>nature</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>puruşa</td>
				<td>ego (subjective)</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<br>

		<div style="border: 1px solid #b5a1e4">
		<p>In saivism, purusa is not a realized soul. Purusa tattva is bound and limited just as ahamkdra lallva is. The only 1 difference that exists between purusa and ahamkara is that (purusa is connected with subjectivity and ahamkara is connected with objectivity. And this purusa is entangled and bound in five ways which are the five kancukas niyati, kala, raga, vidya and kala.</p>
		</div>

		<br>

		<strong>Şat kañcukas — Six Coverings</strong>

		<p>
		<table style="color:#b5a1e1;;width:fit-content;margin:auto">
			<tr>
				<th>Tatva</th>
				<th>Covering</th>
				<th>Example</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>niyati (being in particular place)</td>
				<td>limitation of place</td>
				<td>you are residing in such and such place and not everywhere</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>kāla (time or period)</td>
				<td>limitation of time</td>
				<td>limited to being in particular period.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>rāga (attachment)</td>
				<td>limitation of attachment</td>
				<td>impression of not being complete and always need something</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>vidyā </td>
				<td>limitation of knowledge</td>
				<td>impression of he is not all knowing or knows only limited things</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>kalā</td>
				<td>limitation of action or creativity</td>
				<td>impression that he has art or creativity limited things</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>māyā</td>
				<td>limitation of individuality</td>
				<td>not knowing his real nature and becomes bound to these five kanchukas</td>
			</tr>

		</table>
		</p>
		<br>
		<div>
			<small>
			These five tattvas plus maya are six tattvas which are known as sat kancukas (the six fold coverings). These are the six coverings which bind and entangle and, therefore, limit purusa. He is not limited by only one covering but by six coverings and these coverings must be removed, uncovered, and this is done automatically by the grace of the Master. And through this grace, at the time of real knowledge maya is transformed into His sakti. His great energy. In His glory maya becomes the glory of Parama Siva. When purusa realizes the reality of his nature, maya becomes glory for him.

		<h3>Pure Subjectivity</h3>	

		<strong>Śuddha Tattvas — Pure Elements</strong>

		<table style="color: #cba4d9;">
			<tr>
				<th>tatva</th>
				<th>realization</th>
				<th>State</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>śuddha vidyā</td>
				<td>aham-aham — idam-idam (I-ness in I-ness -- Thisness in Thisness) or simply [I am siva]</td>
				<td>This is when purusa realizes his own nature. but realization is not stable but flickering and moving.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>īśvarā tatva</td>
				<td>idam aham (thisness in I-ness).</td>
				<td>This universe is not illusion it is my own expansion.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>sadāśivā tatva</td>
				<td>aham idam (I-ness in thisness)</td>
				<td>I am this whole universe.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>śakti</td>
				<td>I (pure universal I)</td>
				<td>Pure I</td>

				<td>śivā</td>
				<td>I (pure universal I)</td>

		<p>
			<small>And last is that Being which does not come in the cycle of tattvas. That Being is called </small><span style="color: #cba4d9;">Parama siva</span><small>. Parama Siva is not only found in siva tattva or only found in sakti tattva, it is not only here, it is not only there, </small><span style="color: #cba4d9;">everywhere you will find it.</span><small> You will find it from the lowest tattva to the highest tattva. It is all level that is why It is no level. It is every where, that is why It is nowhere. The one Being who is everywhere It is nowhere.</small>
